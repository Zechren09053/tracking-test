// Implementation steps to add the search functionality to the website

/**
 * Step 1: Add the search styles to your CSS file
 * 
 * Copy all the styles from the "Search Functionality CSS Styles" artifact
 * and add them to your existing clstyle.css file.
 */

/**
 * Step 2: Add the search JavaScript to your page
 * 
 * You have two options:
 * 
 * Option A: Add directly in your existing script tag
 * - Copy the entire code from the "Search Implementation" artifact
 * - Paste it inside your existing <script> tags before the final closing </script>
 * 
 * Option B: Create a separate JS file (recommended)
 * - Create a new file called search.js
 * - Copy the entire code from the "Search Implementation" artifact into this file
 * - Add the following line in your HTML before the closing </body> tag:
 *   <script src="search.js"></script>
 */

/**
 * Step 3: Update your existing search inputs
 * 
 * Your website already has search input fields in both the desktop navigation
 * and mobile sidebar. These are already properly structured for our search
 * function to work with them.
 */

/**
 * Optional Step 4: Track search analytics
 * 
 * If you want to track search usage, you could add the following code to the 
 * performSearch function in the search implementation:
 * 
 * // Add this inside the performSearch function
 * // Track search queries (if you have analytics)
 * if (typeof gtag === 'function') {
 *   gtag('event', 'search', {
 *     search_term: query,
 *     results_count: results.length
 *   });
 * }
 */

/**
 * Testing the search functionality:
 * 
 * 1. After implementing the changes, open the website in a browser
 * 2. Click on the search box and type keywords like:
 *    - "schedule"
 *    - "fare"
 *    - "escolta"
 *    - "route"
 * 3. Press Enter or click the search button
 * 4. Verify that relevant search results appear
 * 5. Click on a search result to navigate to that section
 * 6. Try searching in both desktop and mobile views
 */

/**
 * Known limitations:
 * 
 * 1. This is a client-side search implementation that searches only predefined content.
 * 2. It doesn't search dynamically generated content from PHP (like announcements).
 * 3. For a more comprehensive search, you'd need a server-side implementation.
 */

/**
 * Further enhancements you could consider:
 * 
 * 1. Highlight matching text in search results
 * 2. Add search filters (e.g., by category)
 * 3. Implement fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
 * 4. Add search history or recent searches
 * 5. Implement server-side search for dynamic content
